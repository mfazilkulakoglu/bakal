## About the Project

bakal is online shopping application for ios. You can create an account as a dealer for your sme such as greengrocer, butcher, coffee shop etc. Or you can create an account as a customer and, give an order. bakal is my first project. Therefore I expect comments from everyone who has reviewed the project about anything such as coding, designing, also readme file.

Project was created by using Xcode 13.4.1. You can run this file after installing pods that remarked. You can sign in or sign up with using email/password. The application has two interfaces as dealer and customer. 

As a dealer, you should save your settings like store's name, delivery distance, minimum cost, address, opening and closing time. After that you can pin your store's location. So you can list your products. You can create categories, and add to them products. You can see your order list in the orders tab bar. After choosing one of them, you'll see the details of the order such as products in order, date, customer infos. You can update the statu of orders. If you want to see the location of customer in the apple maps application, you should touch the pin of customer.


As a customer, you should save your settings like dealer. You'll see the all stores in map tab bar. You can see the products when you touch the store pin that you want. You can add products to cart, if it is available. So you can give an orders, follow your orders' status like "Preparing", "On the Way".
